<h3>Hello thereðŸ˜ƒ!</h3>

<h3>I'm Anurag</h3> <h5>an explorer, exploring various relams of Computers. I am currently continuing my undergraduate studies. My passion for computers [purely money] [just kidding. I also love computers] [By the way, if I wanted money, I would have listened to my father and become a doctor] is what got me this far. I hope it also takes me to highest point in the near future. If you have an idea, we'd love to help make it a reality. If you're willing to work, I'm a great team player with great ideas and would be happy to work with you help make them a reality. For specifics, I love any field in CS. I have worked on Web-development, Computer Vision and App-development. I know C, C++, Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Python, SQL, MongoDB, PL/SQL, PHP, jQuery. I am currently learning Rust.</h5>

<h3>
Have a nice day.
I would love to hear from you to collaborate.
</h3>
